An ergonomic, batteries-included HTTP Client for Rust.

- Async and blocking `Client`s
- Plain bodies, JSON, urlencoded, multipart
- Customizable redirect policy
- HTTP Proxies
- HTTPS via system-native TLS (or optionally, rustls)
- Cookie Store
- WASM


## Example

This asynchronous example uses [Tokio](https://tokio.rs) and enables some
optional features, so your `Cargo.toml` could look like this:

```toml
[dependencies]
reqwest = { version = "0.12", features = ["json"] }
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

And then the code:

```rust,no_run
use std::collections::HashMap;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let resp = reqwest::get("https://httpbin.org/ip")
        .await?
        .json::<HashMap<String, String>>()
        .await?;
    println!("{resp:#?}");
    Ok(())
}
```

## Commercial Support

For private advice, support, reviews, access to the maintainer, and the like, reach out for [commercial support][sponsor].

## Requirements

On Linux:

- OpenSSL with headers. See https://docs.rs/openssl for supported versions
  and more details. Alternatively you can enable the `native-tls-vendored`
  feature to compile a copy of OpenSSL.

On Windows and macOS:

- Nothing.

Reqwest uses [rust-native-tls](https://github.com/sfackler/rust-native-tls),
which will use the operating system TLS framework if available, meaning Windows
and macOS. On Linux, it will use the available OpenSSL or fail to build if
not found.
